Project 1 was to find and use datasets to convey a concise, insightful and comprehensive connection between data in order to come to a gretaer conclusion about what data can do for us. However, Data when used in the wrong context can be misinformative. In this project, I set out to use data for Land and Ocean temperatures to see the general upward trend in global temperature and how using information from very recent times and from only a small portion of the world can create bias.
